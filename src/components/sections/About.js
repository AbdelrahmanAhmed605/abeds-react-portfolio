          I am a Full Stack Developer with a solid skill set in multiple web
          languages and frameworks. Currently, I am concluding a coding boot
          camp to enhance my skills and build a robust project portfolio. As a
          quick learner with a strong work ethic, I am constantly pushing myself
          to learn new concepts and stay up-to-date with the latest
          technologies. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy taking
          a leadership role when needed. In the development process, I am a
          resilient problem-solver who uses critical thinking to overcome any
          obstacle that comes my way
