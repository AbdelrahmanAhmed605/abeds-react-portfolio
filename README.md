## Description

Abdelrahman Ahmed is a full-stack developer based in Vancouver, Canada. This project is a display of Abdelrahman's portfolio which showcases his most notable projects to date. The portfolio was created using a React environment and allows viewers to examine his work and determine his level of skills. In this project, Abdelrahman learnt the following skills:
- Setting up a React development environment by configuring tools and dependencies.
- Rendering components and functions from separate files to the React DOM for modular code organization.
- Implementing React Router to create navigational links that render different sections of the application based on the clicked route.
- Utilizing React's useState hook to manage and update state within components, enabling dynamic content and interactivity.
- Applying keys to items rendered within a mapping function to improve efficiency by allowing React to identify and update only the specific modified items, instead of re-rendering the entire list.
